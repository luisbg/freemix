The following are needed to run:
   - python
   - python-gtk2-dev 
   - gstreamer-0.10
   - gstreamer-0.10-plugins-base
   - gstreamer-0.10-plugins-good
   - python-gst0.10


Just run from source
./freemix


You will need a few videos off course!
     the more the better, a few hundreds will
     be enough for the first gigs ;)
